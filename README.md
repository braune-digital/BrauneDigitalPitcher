This PHP component allows to easily send exceptions from your project to the Pitcher App, which will send notifications through different channels (iOS Push Notification, E-Mail or WAMP Websocket). 

## Integrations

Currently thereÂ´s a bundle for Symfony which integrates the component as a service (https://github.com/braune-digital/BrauneDigitalPitcherBundle).

## Installation

Install the package with composer into your project:

```
composer require braune-digital/pitcher "^1.0"
```

## Usage

The BaseClient implements the ClientInterface and allows you to pitch exceptions with GuzzleHTTP to the Pitcher App.

```php
<?php

namespace BrauneDigital\Pitcher\Client;

use Psr\Log\LoggerInterface;

interface ClientInterface {

	/**
	 * @param $level
	 * @param $message
	 * @return mixed
	 */
	public function pitch($level, $message);

	/**
	 * @return mixed
	 */
	public function getLogger();

	/**
	 * @param LoggerInterface $
	 * @return mixed
	 */
	public function setLogger(LoggerInterface $logger);

}
```

You can use this BaseClient and pitch messages:
```php
$client = new \BrauneDigital\Pitcher\Client\BaseClient('SATELLITE_NAME', 'SECRET');
$client->pitch(\BrauneDigital\Pitcher\Notification\Notification::LEVEL_CRITICAL, 'XML API from server B is down');
```

The Pitcher App returns a JSON-Reponse:

```json
{"success":true,"payload":{"level":"critical","message":"XML API from server B is down","date":"2016-04-13T13:23:15+0200","satellite":"YOU_ARE_FREE_TO_CHOOSE_A_NAME","checked":false,"id":141},"errors":[]}
```

Now you will get notifications from the Pitcher app. You can define notification channels in your user profile at http://www.pitcher-app.com/#/login.
